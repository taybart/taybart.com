As stars evolve, they create heavier elements like oxygen, which get dispersed through their host galaxy after they die. Researchers had thought that, at 300 million years old, the Universe was still too young to have galaxies ripe with heavy elements. However, the two ALMA studies indicate JADES-GS-z14-0 has about 10 times more heavy elements than expected.<p>I didn&#x27;t know this so I also wasn&#x27;t surprised by the headline. Although it seems from this quote that they also did expect oxygen to be there, just not as much as they determined to be there. Although I have almost zero interest in space so perhaps this is bigger than I understand. I only clicked on the article because oxygen seems like a pretty simple compound to me and was surprised by the headline. I also think the headline is somewhat misleading due to the point above and how distant the galaxy is isn&#x27;t the actual the newsworthy point as you say. It is only relevant to the extent that light from distant galaxies reaches earth slower.<p>The real headline should be something like &quot;more oxygen than expected is created in young galaxies&quot; which is indeed one of those space articles I would never click on.","comments":[{"id":43425816,"level":2,"user":"SoftTalker","time":1742490300,"time_ago":"a few seconds ago","content":"<p>I&#x27;m no astronomer but I believe that the first stars tended to be huge and short-lived.

And when looking at a very distant galaxy, what we&#x27;re seeing is an image of how it looked like very early in its lifetime. So, the expectation based on certain models was that oxygen would not have yet formed at the time in the history of the universe when this image left towards us.<p>The expectation is indeed that all galaxies will have more or less the exact same elements that we have at ~13 billion years of age. But the image here is from a galaxy that was, at the time the image was emitted towards us, much younger than that.","comments":[]},{"id":43425676,"level":1,"user":"drakonka","time":1742489557,"time_ago":"13 minutes ago","content":"<p>It seems like you could apply similar thinking to aliens, but if we actually got proof of aliens it&#x27;d still be a big deal, right?","comments":[{"id":43425814,"level":2,"user":"saurabh","time":1742490296,"time_ago":"a minute ago","content":"<p>There is no way we are alone in this universe, what would really be a big deal though is if there are somehow able to traverse light years to reach us.","comments":[]},{"id":43425712,"level":2,"user":"baxtr","time":1742489807,"time_ago":"9 minutes ago","content":"<p>Have you not seen the NJ UFO videos of late?

The oxygen existed ~300 million years after the Big Bang. So what has to happen is hydrogen and helium have to coalesce into galaxy and into nebulae, some event probably has to trigger star formation and the stars created have to be really large.<p>To put this in persepctive, our Sun, which is larger than the median star, produces no oxygen and is ~4.5 billion years old.<p>Larger stars are theorized to undergo the so-called CNO cycle [1].
